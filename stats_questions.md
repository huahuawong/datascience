# Q1. Imagine a deck of 500 cards numbered from 1 to 500. If all the cards are shuffled randomly and you are asked to pick three cards,
one at a time, what's the probability of each subsequent card being larger than the previous drawn card?


Proposed solution: Question may seem confusing at first, but really what you have to do is think about the scenario of drawing 3 cards.
Let's say what we drew in the end is 1, 2, 3. There are 6 possible ways that you can draw these cards. (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3),
(2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1) and (1, 2, 3) is the arrangement that we want. Thus, the probability of that would be (1/6)

# Q2. Explain what is p value?
Before we talk about what is p value, we should understand what is null hypothesis. Null hypothesis is a hypothesis that states that when we
introduce a change to a system, there will be zero to none effects. If there really is no effect, we can declare that the null 
hypothesis is true, and p value evaluate how well our sample data support the null hypothesis.

High P values (typically > 0.05) means that data is likely with a true null hypothesis
Low P values (typically â‰¤ 0.05) means that data is unlikely with a true null hypothesis
