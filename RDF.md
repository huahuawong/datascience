# Introduction to RDF 
## First of all, what is RDF?
RDF stnads for Resource Descriptive Framework, and is a standard model to describe data interchange. It is one of the building blocks of semantic web

## What's semantic web? And what function does RDF play?
Semantic Web is an extension of the current web in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation. 

RDF can be used as a tool that have a finer and more detailed classification and characterization of those relationships as well as the resources being characterized. This ensures interoperability, more complex automatic behaviors. For example, a community can agree what name to use for a relationship connecting a page to one’s calendar; this name can then be used by a large number of users and applications without the necessity to redefine such names every time.

## How does semantic web relate to data science?
Some parts of the Semantic Web technologies are based on results of Artificial Intelligence research, like knowledge representation (e.g., for ontologies or rules), model theory (e.g., for the precise semantics of RDF and RDF Schemas), or various types of logics (e.g., for rules). However, it must be noted that Artificial Intelligence has a number of research areas (e.g., image recognition) that are completely orthogonal to the Semantic Web.

It is also true that the development of the Semantic Web brought some new perspectives to the Artificial Intelligence community: the “Web effect”, i.e., the merge of knowledge coming from different sources, usage of URIs, the necessity to reason with incomplete data; etc.

## Okay so, what's RDF exactly?
RDF is a framework for describing resources on the web and is designed to be read and understood by computers
