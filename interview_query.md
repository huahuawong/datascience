# Q1. This question was asked by: Facebook. Let's say you're playing a dice game. You have 2 die. 
## 1. What's the probability of rolling at least one 3?
Look at it this way, the probability of rolling at least one 3, means we can roll 3 once, or roll 3 twice. And bear in mind, there are 6*6 == 36 total combinations
P(at least one 3) = P(getting one 3) + P(getting two 3s)
                  = (10/36) + (1/36)
                  = 11/36
                  
## 2. What's the probability of rolling at least one 3 given N die?
