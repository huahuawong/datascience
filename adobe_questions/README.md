The exact words of the assignment is:

Please fit a model using the data provided and send your predicted values:

Use your model to create predicted values of y given the variables a-h in the file: intern_test.csv.

Respond with a file intern_predicted.csv which contains two columns:

i: the index from intern_test.csv, 
y: your predicted values

Please also include the code you used to generate the predicted values in your response. We would prefer that you use Python, R, Java, or Scala for the exercise.
