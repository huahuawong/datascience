#1 Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for 
each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

# We use left join because we don't care about what's going on the right side, i.e. the address
# If we don't care if there is a last name for each person, we'd use RIHGT JOIN

SELECT Person.FirstName, Person.LastName, Address.City, Address.State 
FROM Person LEFT JOIN Address on Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId;
