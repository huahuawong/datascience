Q1. Imagine a deck of 500 cards numbered from 1 to 500. If all the cards are shuffled randomly and you are asked to pick three cards,
one at a time, what's the probability of each subsequent card being larger than the previous drawn card?


Proposed solution: Question may seem confusing at first, but really what you have to do is think about the scenario of drawing 3 cards.
Let's say what we drew in the end is 1, 2, 3. There are 6 possible ways that you can draw these cards. (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3),
(2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1) and (1, 2, 3) is the arrangement that we want. Thus, the probability of that would be (1/6)
